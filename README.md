# Bootstrap MEWC

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Latest Release:**
   - Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/cdonnachie/mewc_bootstrap/releases).
   - Download the latest `.zip` release file.

2. **Extract the Zip File:**
   - Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file.

    **WARNING: Before proceeding to the next step, ensure that your wallet is closed.**

3. **Getting the wallet ready for the bootstrap:**
   - Open Meowcoin folder %appdata%/Meowcoin (Windows) or ~/.meowcoin (Linux)
   - Create a folder named `backup` inside the Meowcoin wallet folder location and move all files and folders (except `wallet.dat`) into it.
   - You should be left with just the backup folder and wallet.dat file inside the Meowcoin folder.
   - Set aside the Meowcoin folder.

4. **Extract `mewc-bootstrap.zip` to Meowcoin Folder:**
   - double click on `mewc-bootstrap.zip`.
   - Copy the contents to the Meowcoin folder (not in the backup folder).

5. **Run Your Wallet:**
   - You can now run your wallet.
   - Your wallet will benefit from a head start on blocks, and the synchronization process should be significantly faster, bringing it to 100% more quickly.
   - I your wallet is fully synched, than you can remove the `backup` folder created earlier. (Dont delete your `wallet.dat` file by accident, that would suck.)
